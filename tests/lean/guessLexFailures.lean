A few cases where guessing the lexicographic order fails, and
where we want to keep tabs on the output.

All functions take more than one changing argument, because the guesslex
code skips non-mutuals unary functions with only one plausible measure.

def nonTerminating : Nat → Nat → Nat

  | n, m => nonTerminating (.succ n) (.succ m)

-- Saying decreasing_by forces Lean to use structural recursion, which gives a different
-- error message

  | 0, _ => 0
  | n, m => nonTerminating2 (.succ n) (.succ m)

-- The GuessLex code does not like eta-contracted motives in `casesOn`.
-- At the time of writing, the error message is swallowed
-- When guessing the lexicographic order becomes more verbose this will improve.
